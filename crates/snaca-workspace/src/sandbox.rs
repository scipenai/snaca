//! Linux landlock sandbox helper used by `BashTool`.
//!
//! Applied as a `pre_exec` hook on the Bash child: after fork, before
//! the shell takes over, we install a landlock ruleset that restricts
//! the process to:
//! - **read + write** access under the project workspace,
//! - **read-only** access to a small set of system directories so the
//!   shell can resolve binaries (`/usr`, `/bin`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/etc`).
//!
//! Anything else — `/tmp`, `/home/<user>`, `/proc/<other>`, the project
//! data root outside this tenant's slice — is invisible to write syscalls.
//! Reads outside the read-only set are also denied; that's intentional, so
//! a curious model can't slurp other tenants' workspaces.
//!
//! Landlock requires kernel 5.13+ (ABI v1) for write restrictions; we ask
//! for the highest ABI the kernel supports and degrade gracefully when
//! unsupported (the syscall path returns Err and the caller logs/skips).
//!
//! On non-Linux platforms this module compiles to a no-op stub so the
//! rest of the crate stays portable.
