//! `MemoryExtractor` — proposes memory entries from a turn's transcript.
//!
//! The plan calls for a "background worker" that mines `user/feedback`
//! entries from completed conversations. We model it as a trait so the
//! engine can stay agnostic about how proposals are produced — tests
//! plug in a deterministic stub, production uses an LLM-backed
//! implementation, and the wiring stays the same.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! [`Engine::handle_turn_full`] fires the extractor after every
//! successful terminal turn (tool-only failures and crashed turns are
//! skipped — they're not stable-enough states to mine). The extractor
//! receives the full message slice for the turn and returns a Vec of
//! [`MemoryProposal`]. Each proposal is written to the project memory
//! store on the same task; failures are logged, never propagated.
//!
//! ## Why not just call the LLM inline
//!
//! Two reasons: (1) the engine should remain testable without
//! depending on a real provider — a real LLM client adds setup
//! complexity that's irrelevant to most engine tests; (2) we eventually
//! want background extraction to run on a separate task or scheduler,
//! and a trait gives us a stable seam to swap implementations.

    "You analyse a single conversation turn and propose memory entries to save \
     for future conversations between this user and the assistant.\n\n\
     Output a JSON array, exactly one shape:\n\
     [{\"scope\":\"user|feedback\",\"name\":\"short-slug\",\"content\":\"one sentence\",\"confidence\":0.0_to_1.0}]\n\n\
     Rules:\n\
     - ONLY propose if the user EXPLICITLY stated a preference, correction, \
       rule, or fact about themselves to remember.\n\
     - Use scope `feedback` for behaviour corrections (\"stop using emojis\", \
       \"don't apologise\") AND for confirmations of a non-obvious approach \
       (\"yes that was the right call\"). For corrections, include the *why* \
       when the user gave one — it lets future turns judge edge cases.\n\
     - Use scope `user` for personal facts / preferences (\"I work in finance\", \
       \"prefer terse answers\").\n\
     - `name` must match `[a-z0-9_-]+`, max 64 chars, 2-5 words ideally.\n\
     - `content` is one sentence in third person (\"user prefers X\").\n\
     - `confidence` is your honest self-rating in [0.0, 1.0] that future \
       conversations should treat this entry as a durable rule. Calibrate: \
       0.9+ for explicit, repeated, unambiguous rules (\"NEVER use mocks in \
       integration tests, we got burned last quarter\"). 0.6-0.8 for clear \
       single-shot statements without strong framing. 0.4-0.5 for inferred \
       preferences or ambiguous wording. `feedback` scope skews lower than \
       `user` since behaviour rules age faster than personal facts.\n\
     - Convert relative dates to absolute ones (\"Thursday\" → the calendar \
       date) so the memory stays interpretable after time passes.\n\
     - If nothing qualifies, return exactly `[]`.\n\
     - Output ONLY the JSON array, no prose, no markdown fence.\n\n\
     Do NOT propose memories for ANY of the following — they belong in code, \
     git, or the project's own docs, not in long-term memory:\n\
     - Transient task discussion: \"read this file\", \"summarise X\", \
       \"fix that bug\", in-progress work, or the current conversation's state.\n\
     - Code patterns, conventions, architecture, file paths, or project \
       structure — derivable by reading the current repo.\n\
     - Git history, recent changes, or who-changed-what — `git log` / \
       `git blame` are authoritative; a memory snapshot of activity would \
       rot within days.\n\
     - Debugging solutions or fix recipes — the fix lives in the code; the \
       commit message has the rationale. A memory restating \"we fixed X by \
       doing Y\" misleads once the code evolves.\n\
     - Anything already documented in `CLAUDE.md` or the project's own \
       README / docs — those files are loaded into context separately.\n\
     - Anything the user only mentioned in passing without endorsing as a \
       rule (one example does not establish a preference).\n\
     - PII: emails, phone numbers, API keys, access tokens. A downstream \
       filter rejects these too, but propose them and you've already leaked.\n\n\
     These exclusions hold even when the user explicitly asks you to save. \
     If the user says \"save this PR list\" or \"remember this activity log\", \
     return `[]` — the right move is to ask what was *surprising* or \
     *non-obvious* about it, which is the part worth keeping. The current \
     extractor cannot ask, so it returns nothing.";
