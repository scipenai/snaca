//! `MemoryStore` — manages the on-disk memory tree for one project.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! ```text
//! <root>/
//!   MEMORY.md                  ← index, ≤ 200 lines / ≤ 25 KB, regenerated on every write
//!   user/<name>.md
//!   project/<name>.md
//!   reference/<name>.md
//!   feedback/<name>.md
//! ```
//!
//! The store is concerned only with the *file tree* — not embeddings,
//! classification, or transcript retrieval. Import, frozen-snapshot
//! rendering, and session search live in adjacent modules/crates.
//!
//! ## Path safety
//!
//! Entry names are validated by [`sanitize_name`] before they ever touch
//! the filesystem: only `[a-z0-9_-]`, max 64 chars, no extension. We
//! re-add `.md` ourselves so a malicious name can't drop a `.sh` or a
//! traversal sequence. Names are *case-folded* at the boundary so
//! `User` and `user` collide instead of producing two ghost entries.
//!
//! ## Index file
//!
//! `MEMORY.md` is regenerated wholesale on every write: scan the four
//! scope dirs, collect entry names, render a Markdown list. We hard-cap
//! the rendered text at 200 lines and 25 KB. When the cap is hit the
//! oldest entries (by mtime) are listed first; everything beyond is
//! summarised as `… N more entries (run `/memory list <scope>` to see all)`.
